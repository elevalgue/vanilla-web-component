# **Web Component Specifications** 

- In this module, you'll learn all about the **building blocks of a web component**, 
- which are four web standards. 
- You will look at each of the standards in detail, and get stuck into some code to learn how use each of them. 
- This module will build the perfect foundation for learning how to build **high quality web components**. 

Before we jump into the web components specifications, let's take a short moment to clarify exactly what a web component is: When we build web applications, 
there are **three fundamental building blocks**. These are **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 
- HTML allows us to define this trip to other web pages, HTML is the markup. 
- CSS allows us to control the visual aspects of the markup, 
- and JavaScript allows us to add logic, and extended functionality to our web apps. 

With the four standards that make up the web component specification, we are able to bring these three technologies together seamlessly, and are able to 
finally build **truly encapsulated and easily reusable components** for the web. 

This course is specifically about vanilla web components. But what exactly are vanilla web components?
This means that web components are more portable and reusable. One of the most important features of web components is the ability to create sub-DOM tree 
exclusively for a single web component. This **sub-DOM tree** will not inherit style from the appliation, and equally, component styling will not leak to the 
outer application, solving the conflict issues, which plagues other component eco systms. To summarize, the benefits web components provide over other component 
implementations. Web components give a style **encapsulation** through the ability to create a sub-DOM tree, which solves all kinds of conflict issues in our apps. 
Because web components only rely on browser features, there are few dependencies and prerequisites. Web components **are not tied into any particular library or 
framework**, and can be used in conjunction with any library or framework as long as it uses the DOM. Because of this agnostic nature, we can more easily 
migrate and upgrade frameworks and libraries, giving longer lives to the components in our apps. Web components give us these capabilities by bringing 
together four web standards. **These web standards are custom elements, shadow DOM, HTML templates, and HTML imports**. Each of these standards provides web 
components with a different capability. They are almost like web component superpowers. This module will guide you through using each of these web standards 
outside of the web component eco system, because it is important to understand how each functions independently.
