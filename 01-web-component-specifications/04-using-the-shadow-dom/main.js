// The Shadow DOM is a sub-DOM tree attached to a DOM elememt. This means that this element can contain and mantain its own encapsulated DOM tree.

// Shadow DOM provides true encapsulation for elements

// These sub-DOM trees do not inherit style from the main application, giving developers complete control over how content within these sub-trees look. 

// When we create a sub-DOM tree for an element, there are two types available to us. There is open, which means we will. There is open, which means we will have complete control over the sub-DOM tree, and closed, where is not possible to manipukate the sub-DOM tree after it has been created. 

// You will probably never use the close type of Shadow DOM. 

// In this demo, I will show you how can you use the Shadow DOM API to create a sub-DOM tree for an element. Then we'll see how to add content to the sud-DOM tree, and the Shadow DOM in action, so we can see how it encapsulation works.
