    <!-----Let's create our own DOM element------>
    <script>
      // 1. With this class we're defining our custom element

      // 2. and we extends the HTML element interface which will give us the typical methods and properties a DOM element is requiered to have.

      class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
          // 3. We define a CONSTRUCTOR where we must ALWAYS call SUPER to construct the parent.

          // In this case, this is the HTML element interface.

          super();
          console.log('My Custom Element constructed!');
          // 7. We render this in the browser. We can see that the constructor is called thanks to the console.log
        }
        connectedCallback() {
          console.log('My Custom Element added to the DOM!');
        }
        static get observedAttributes() {
          return ['demo'];
          attributeChangedCallBalk(name, oldValue, newValue);
          console.log('Attribute Changed', name, oldValue, newValue);
        }
      }

      // 4. Now we have to tell the browser about the CLASS that defines our custom element and specify and HTML tag. To do this we use a custom element API

      // 5. Using the defined method, we first provide the tag name, which must have a hyphen and then the element's prototype, which is the CLASS we have just created.

      window.customElements.define('my-custom-element', MyCustomElement);

      // Now the browser will know how to construct any DOM elements with the tag name of "MyCustomElement"

      //
    </script>
  </head>
  <!-- 6. Now we're adding this element to the body so we can see it in action -->
  <body>
    <my-custom-element></my-custom-element>
  </body>
  <!-- We have created a simple custom element with nothing other than a constructor -->
  <!-- The constructor is executed when an instance of the custom element is created. In addition to the constructor, the custom element API defines some lifecycle callback methods that can be used to execute code at certain times in the element's lifecycle-->
