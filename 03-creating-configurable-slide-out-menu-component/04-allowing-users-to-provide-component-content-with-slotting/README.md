# **Opening and closing the Menu**

## **In this demo:**

- We'll define the open property, which will allow the menu to be toggled open and closed.
- We'll ensure the menu is closed when the user clicks the backdrop or the close button.
- We'll add the CSS which allows the user to disable the backdrop.
