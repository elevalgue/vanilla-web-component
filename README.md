# **Vanilla Web Components** 

Web components solve fundamental problems that web developers have been putting up with since the dawn of the web. These problems include style encapsulation, reusability, interruptability, and the big one, framework lock-in. This course is for web developers who want to get ready for the next big shift in front-end web development. In the course, I'll introduce you to the web components specifications and their superpowers. We'll also create two high-quality web components which will demonstrate the specifications in detail. By the end of the course, you'll be able to write top quality encapsulated UI components which can be used in nearly any front-end technology stack. They'll be reusable, extensible, and themeable, and I'll also show you how to make them production-ready by preparing them for cross-platform use, including legacy browsers such as IE 11. Web components have been a long time coming to the web platform, and they're finally here. With libraries, frameworks, and even entire conferences dedicated to web components, now is the perfect time to dive deep into this exciting new technology to discover the possibilities they'll open for you and the applications you create.
