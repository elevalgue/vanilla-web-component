# **Web Components Attributes**

- Are one way your web components can receive data and publish date
- In this demo we'll see how easy is to handle attributes on your components based on the quotes exercise.

## **In this demo:**

- We'll build on top of the random quote component we built in the previous demostration. We'll make the interval configurable by using attributes and also how we can use an attribute to share which quote is currently being displayed.
