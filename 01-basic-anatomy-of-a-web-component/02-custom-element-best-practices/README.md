# **Custom Element Best Practices **

- Use CamelCase
- The names might be short
- When choosing the element name, convert the CamelCase class to a hyphen telemeter string.
- When creating a custom element, your element tag much have a hyphen in to distinguish it from the native elements.
- Use a prefix in your element name. Your element name has to be unique. If we called our component simple RandomQuote, it's very likely to someone else will do or has already created a component with that name. This means that your component and the other component can0t coexist in the same page.
- This is an unwritten rule, but prefixing a variable or method with an underscore means that it's private and probably shouldn't be used externally
