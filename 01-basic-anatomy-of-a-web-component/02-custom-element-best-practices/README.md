# **Custom Element Best Practices**

- Class and element naming conventions
- Implementing custom methods
- Defining local variables
- Updating the component template

# **Some tips:**

- Use **CamelCase**
- The **names** might be **short**
- When choosing the element name, convert the CamelCase class to a **hyphen telemeter string**.
- When creating a **custom element**, your **element tag must have a hyphen** in to distinguish it from the native elements.
- **Use a prefix in your element name**. Your element name has to be unique. If we called our component simple RandomQuote, it's very likely to someone else 
will do or has already created a component with that name. This means that your component and the other component can0t coexist in the same page.
- This is an unwritten rule, but prefixing a variable or method with an underscore means that it's private and probably shouldn't be used externally
