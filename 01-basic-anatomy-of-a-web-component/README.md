# **Basic Anatomy of a Web Component**

In this module, we'll show you how to build the basic structure of a web component. More specifically, you'll learn the **two different methods** for 
**writing a component and why you would choose one method over the other**. 

I'll introduce you to some best practices for creating custom elements for your components. **DOM element and attributes are a large part of the work component
ecosystem**, so we will look at how best to handle them. We'll look at how to **define and use properties** of a work component and finally, I'll show you how 
to use the **Shadow Dom** with your components. Before you start writing web components, you'll first need to decide how you want to write them. There are 
currently **two common methods**, each of which have their own advantages or disadvantages which is what we're going to cover now.
