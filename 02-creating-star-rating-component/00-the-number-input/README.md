# **The Number input**

- Does more than just take a number from the user
- The number input implements the [HTMLInputelEment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement)interface, which provide a large API including a variety of properties and methods. In context of our Rating Star Component, we are only interested in the **disable state**, **the value attribute**, **the value property** and when the **change event is fired**.
- Most input elements have a value attribute. We'll probably use it, at least on a text input. The number input has one also and setting it, we can see that it updates the input's value and it will also keep reacting to the changes.

## **In this demo:**

- We'll discover some important answers about the number element so we can understand how to best write our star rating components.
- We need to learn what attributes the number element uses, does the element react to those attribute changes and when.
- What properties does it have.
- What events does it fire and when
