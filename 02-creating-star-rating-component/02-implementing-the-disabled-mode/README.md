# **Implementing the Disabld Mode**

## **In this demo:**

- We'll use some CSS to prevent hover and change the user's cursor.
- We'll utilize a private variable to keep track of whether the element is disabled or not.
- And we'll watch the attribute changes so we know when the element should be put in put in disabled mode.
